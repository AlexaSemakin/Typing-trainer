Their parents lived opposite to each other in two garrets, where the roofs of neighboring houses projected out towards each other and the water - pipe ran between them. In each house was a little window, so that any one could step across the gutter from one window to the other. The parents of these children had each a large wooden box in which they cultivated kitchen herbs for their own use, and a little rose - bush in each box, which grew splendidly. Now after a while the parents decided to place these two boxes across the water - pipe, so that they reached from one window to the other and looked like two banks of flowers.
