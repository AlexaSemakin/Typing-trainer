"Will you have that knife with you while you are asleep?" asked Gerda, looking at it in great fright. "I always sleep with the knife by me," said the robber - girl. "No one knows what may happen. But now tell me again all about little Kay, and why you went out into the world. " Then Gerda repeated her story over again, while the wood - pigeons in the cage over her cooed, and the other pigeons slept. The little robber - girl put one arm across Gerdaâ€™s neck, and held the knife in the other, and was soon fast asleep and snoring. But Gerda could not close her eyes at all; she knew not whether she was to live or die.
